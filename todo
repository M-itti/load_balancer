 
concurrency: Implementing a load balancer involves handling multiple requests concurrently. This can be an excellent way to practice using goroutines and channels in Go.
mock nodes 

routing algorithms: round-robin, least connections, or IP hashing.

1. select servers with algorithm


2. option to:
- bind port of loadbalancer for specific protocols 
80, 443

- select balancer algorithm
- add caching
- consider protocol support https, tcp, other high level protocols
# TODO: if health is not working remove server on runtime (read more about nginx)
- graceful shutdown on a keyboard error or signal
